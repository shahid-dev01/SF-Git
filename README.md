t's been two years since Microsoft launched the Surface Pro 9 or Surface Laptop 5. Finally, the company appears ready to launch succeeding models at this week's event. 

Microsoft's Surface and Windows AI event will be held on March 21 at 9:00 a.m. PDT/ 12:00 p.m. ET. The event's webpage describes the event as, "Advancing the new era of work with Copilot," hinting that the event's focus will be on enterprise offerings. It will be a digital event, meaning there will be no in-person component with the press or public.

As the title and description suggest, ZDNET expects a large focus on generative AI at the event, where the company will unveil its latest AI updates to Windows 11 and Copilot, likely tied to the launch of new Surface hardware.

The real stars of the show, however, will be the highly anticipated Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6. These launches will mark Microsoft's first laptops in the era of the AI PC. The laptops will be marketed as AI PCs because they feature hardware to better support new generative AI tools and features.
